# CI Learning

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylerdmoore/ci_learning.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kylerdmoore/ci_learning)

Hey there! So basically all I've done here is boot up a simple Laravel project and created a basic calculator. After that I wrote some unit test cases and feature test cases. After that became the part where I needed to do some learning. I've done tons of reading and the concepts and ideas behind continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment but never was able to get my hands dirty and make something actually happen. In my research in the past I've read through almost all of the Travis CI documentation and found it to be the most coder friendly tool (it is also free for open source projects), so that is the tool I chose. I created the config file (.travis.yml) and I followed the basics in the documentation to come up with a pretty basic configuration that I couldn't figure out how to get to fire. I know that builds are really only fired on pushes, pulls, merges, pull requests, and things of that nature so I decided to extend my simple little app with a new feature. The new feature was just to implement some bootstrap styles so I changed stuff around, did a npm install and complied assets with mix. After lots of tweaking the travis config I finally came up with one that worked. It is only testing the PHP side of things so there are no npm, webpack, or browsers tests...yet.
